              I was born to love. I find joy in expressing dance and song.
              <br />
              <br />
              I live for sound and was awarded a degree in Audio Engineering and Production at Catalyst, in Funkhaus Berlin. I also hold certificates in Computer Science, including AI and web development. This website was built by me.
