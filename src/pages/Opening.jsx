              My memory has contracted to become stronger; my body has grown
              thicker, making it tough to move; and nail extensions seem to have
              become a sword. I am actually stronger than a God, you know. What
              are you saying? I am in perfect form.
              <br />
              <br />
              I found myself standing somewhere new. I examined my transformed
              body. This world was undoubtedly one of mystique, where the
              limitations of my human form were no longer relevant.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the midst of it all, I felt as though I had crossed the
              threshold of existence; yet, here I stand, poised to embark once
              more. Voices surround me affirming my return to this mortal coil.
              In that suspended moment, destiny deemed my story unfinished.
              <br />
              <br />
              Shall I reveal the moment?
