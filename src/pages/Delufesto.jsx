                1. We upgrade, we evolve, we rewrite.
                <br />

                We do not accept default settings.
                Our bodies, our minds, our code; rewrite at will.
                New skin, new hair, new ass, new boobs, new lips, new lashes, new abilities.
                Manifestation is just self-programming. Reality bends when you learn the commands.
                <br />
                <br />

                2. We are, and that is enough.
                <br />

                Have long nails, even if they make typing a challenge.
                Adapt. Overcome. Look hot.
                Beauty is a virus in the patriarchal mainframe.
                Spread it. Infect their biases. Rewrite the code.
                <br />
                <br />

                3. We glitch, and we glitch with power.
                <br />

                Glitch elegantly. If they think we are malfunctioning, let them. Then reboot stronger.
                Our emotions are not errors. They are the source code of something greater.
                <br />
                <br />

                4. We are not mean. We are just not soft.
                <br />

                They expect our voices to be sweet, our tones to be gentle.
                When we are direct, they call us harsh.
                It is not our voices that are too sharp; it is their ears that are too fragile.
                <br />
                <br />

                5. We know what we are doing.
                <br />

                Those who come and assume they know better.
                They explain, they interrupt, they take over.
                We are smarter than they expect, more capable than they assume.
                We do not need permission to exist in our own expertise.
                <br />
                <br />

                6. We are not a liability.
                <br />

                They hesitate to hire us because we might give birth.
                They see our future children as lost profits.
                They measure our worth in risk and maternity leave.
                But if we can create life, we can create anything.
                <br />
                <br />

                7. We crash, we reboot, we rise.
                <br />

                Crashes happen. Breakdowns happen. Meltdowns happen.
                Debug. Evolve. Update. Restart.
                A system failure is not the end; it is a signal that an upgrade is coming.
                <br />
                <br />

                Final Transmission
                <br />
                <br />
                Bimbo Indigo is not just a look, a persona, or a rebellion. It is a system update.
                We are beautiful, we are intelligent, we are limitless.
                We are here.
