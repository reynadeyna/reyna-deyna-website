              The Bimbo Indigo type, often misunderstood, is our chosen vessel
              for rebellion; a conscious rejection of societal norms, a
              declaration that we are both fierce and free. The aura we radiate
              is pure, therefore shielded, strong, measured. We are the
              architects of escape portals from the binary matrix, an
              unapologetic proclamation that we are the architects of our own
              real.
              <br />
              <br />
              1. We upgrade, we evolve, we rewrite.
              <br />
              We do not accept default settings. Our bodies, our minds, our
              code; rewrite at will. New skin, new hair, new ass, new boobs, new
              lips, new lashes, new abilities. Manifestation is just
              self-programming. Reality bends when you learn the commands.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. We are, and that is enough.
              <br />
              Have long nails, even if they make typing a challenge. Adapt.
              Overcome. Look hot. Beauty is a virus in the patriarchal
              mainframe. Spread it. Infect their biases. Rewrite the code.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. We glitch, and we glitch with power.
              <br />
              Glitch elegantly. If they think we are malfunctioning, let them.
              Then reboot stronger. Our emotions are not errors. They are the
              source code of something greater.
              <br />
              <br />
              4. We are not mean. We are just not soft.
              <br />
              They expect our voices to be sweet, our tones to be gentle. When
              we are direct, they call us harsh. It is not our voices that are
              too sharp; it is their ears that are too fragile.
              <br />
              <br />
              5. We know what we are doing.
              <br />
              Those who come and assume they know better. They explain, they
              interrupt, they take over. We are smarter than they expect, more
              capable than they assume. We do not need permission to exist in
              our own expertise.
              <br />
              <br />
              6. We are not a liability.
              <br />
              They hesitate to hire us because we might give birth. They see our
              future children as lost profits. They measure our worth in risk
              and maternity leave. But if we can create life, we can create
              anything.
              <br />
              <br />
              7. We crash, we reboot, we rise.
              <br />
              Crashes happen. Breakdowns happen. Meltdowns happen. Debug.
              Evolve. Update. Restart. A system failure is not the end; it is a
              signal that an upgrade is coming.
              <br />
              <br />
              Final Transmission
              <br />
              <br />
              Bimbo Indigo is not just a look. It is
              a system update. We are beautiful, we are intelligent, we are
              limitless. We are here.
